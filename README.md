#  Task 2 – To-Do List CLI App (Python)

This project is part of the Python Developer Internship.  
The goal is to build a simple *console-based To-Do List* that allows the user to manage tasks using file storage.

##  Objective
Create a command-line app that:
- Adds tasks
- Views all tasks
- Deletes tasks
- Saves tasks to a file (tasks.txt) so they remain after the program is closed

##  Tools Used
- Python
- Terminal / Command Prompt
- Any code editor (VS Code recommended)

##  Files
- todo.py → Python script with the to-do app logic
- tasks.txt → Stores tasks persistently (automatically created)

##  How to Run

```bash
python todo.py

The menu will be displayed:
